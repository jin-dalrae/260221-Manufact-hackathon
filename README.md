# ArduinoMCP: The Future of Hardware Prototyping 🚀

> **ArduinoMCP is the world’s first AI co-pilot for the physical world.** We bridge the gap between imagination and hardware reality, removing the friction from Arduino development through the power of MCP (Model Context Protocol).

---

## ⚡️ The Problem
Hardware development is currently stuck in the 2000s. Developers spend **70% of their time** searching for datasheets, debugging missing resistors, and fighting boilerplate code instead of building. 

**Prototyping is slow, error-prone, and documentation is scattered.**

## 💎 The Solution: ArduinoMCP
ArduinoMCP brings **Generative AI to the Breadboard**. We automate the entire hardware lifecycle—from a simple text description to a verified circuit, functional firmware, and a curated shopping cart.

## 🛠 Product Showcase

### 1. **AI Circuit Builder (Dynamic UI)**
Our signature **`arduino-circuit-builder`** widget is an all-in-one workspace.
*   **Generative Firmware**: Real-time `.ino` code generation.
*   **Visual Schematics**: Dynamic SVG previews of your wiring.
*   **Automated BOM**: Instant parts list with Adafruit/Digikey links.

### 2. **Metadata-Enabled Discovery**
*   **Global Part Search**: Find sensors, actuators, and MCUs with fuzzy-matching.
*   **Instant Datasheets**: Forget Google; get electrical specs and PDF links directly in your chat.

### 3. **Verification & Vision**
*   **Safety Audit**: Rule-based validation to prevent short-circuits.
*   **Photo-to-Schema**: Upload a photo of your mess of wires, and ArduinoMCP will map it back to a clean digital schematic.

## 📈 Roadmap: Scaling to the Physical Edge

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation (Hackathon)** – Core toolset, modular engine, and React widgets.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Live Supply Chain** – Direct API integration with DigiKey, Mouser, and Farnell for real-time stock and checkout.
- [ ] **Phase 3: CAD/CAM Automation** – Automated 3D enclosure generation (STL/STEP) based on component dimensions.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Multi-Target Support** – Expanding beyond Arduino to ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico, and custom PCBs.
